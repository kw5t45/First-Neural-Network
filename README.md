# First-Neural-Network

Creating my first neural network from scratch using only numpy.<br>
This is the classic neural network which recognizes hand written digits<br> from 0 - 9,
from a csv file downloaded MNIST database.<br>
The images in the CSV are 28x28 (labeled), <br>
and our goal is to get the script to tell us the correct label corresponding to chosen image.
